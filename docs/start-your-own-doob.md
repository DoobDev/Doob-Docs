# Start your own Doob!

{% hint style="danger" %}
THIS DOCUMENT IS OUTDATED.
{% endhint %}

## First, download both Python and Git.

You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You can download Git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

{% hint style="info" %}
For the Python installation, make sure you download Python to path.
{% endhint %}

## Now, clone the bot.

Cloning the bot is super easy with Git! Just type this command:

```text
git clone https://github.com/DoobDev/doob.git
```

Then the project should start downloading into the directory your terminal was in.

## Install the requirements.

To install the prerequisites for the bot, run this command:

```text
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Get your bot's token. 

You can get your bot's token [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

## Start the bot.

I use Windows Server for running the official Doob bot, so this is how I start the bot.

1. Open the folder.
2. Right click the bot.py file.
3. Click "Open with IDLE"
4. At the top click Run, then "Run... Customized" \(or use the keyboard shortcut 'Shift+F5'\)
5. Click "Ok" on the box that pops up.
6. Once the program starts, it will ask you 2 questions, "Copy and paste the Discord Bot Token." and "Input your Top.gg bot token." Since you are running a modified version of another bot, your bot will get declined on Top.gg, so answer the first question, then just press enter on the second question.
7. Done! The bot should be up and running!
